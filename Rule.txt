
[Goblet Gobblers]

This is a new type of Tic Toc Toe.
I reproduct the board game on the browser, 
so this is not my original game.

[Rule]
This is similar to normal TicTocToe, but this 
game has pieces which is different size: small, 
midium, large. 
As you might expect, you can put a larger sized piece on smaller one and you can pick up  a
 piece from the board.
And, the player who made winning line will
be winner.

[Caution]
When you pick up a piece from the board 
and the winning line is completed at the 
moment, the player whose pieces make 
the winning line is winner.
